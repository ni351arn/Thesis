  abstract = {The convergence of AI with DevOps introduces progressive automatization and increases preventive system dependability in modern software construction. Many initial DevOps practices centred around continuous integration, delivery and deployment models have limits when dealing with more complex and distributed systems. AI can revolutionize the DevOps approach by automating mundane tasks, enhancing the team's productivity, and providing solutions to avoid system failure that may result in downtime. Indeed, by correlating Derivative events with the relevant Root Causes and analyzing patterns in and performances of computer systems, this paper examines how various forms of AI -- including predictive analytics and 'self-healing' techniques -- can raise DevOps processes to new levels of intelligence and optimization. The work introduces a new concept of employing autonomous ML models to maintain always-on delivery pipelines and prevent system failures, thus demonstrating the effects of AI on deployment frequency, mean time to recovery, and failure rate.

Traditional static security models have been frequently experienced to fail in in line with the dynamic nature of CI/CD workflows, hence allowing undetected vulnerabilities to persist and prolonging remediation. This study proposes the utilization of reinforcement learning (RL) for optimizing cybersecurity risk modeling and testing in CI/CD pipelines. The system makes maximum use of real-time threat intelligence, in combination with dynamic test selection techniques, toward maximum detection of vulnerabilities within the smallest possible amount of resource allocation. RL agents are trained to always push severe test scenarios first in a way to better absorb changing attacks and codebase dynamics. Empirical study results show improved detection rates, less test time, and better risk visibility in all stages of the pipeline, marking a major fight toward intelligent and adaptive DevOps security practices.},

  abstract = {The rapid adoption of cloud infrastructure has transformed organizational operations, offered scalability and flexibility but also exposed enterprises to sophisticated cyber threats, such as data breaches, ransomware, and insider attacks. AI-based threat detection systems have emerged as a critical solution, leveraging machine learning, deep learning, and behavioral analytics to identify and mitigate threats in real time. This paper proposes novel architecture for AI-based threat detection in cloud infrastructure, addressing the unique challenges of dynamic, distributed environments. Through a systematic literature review and mixed-method evaluation, the study synthesizes insights from cybersecurity, cloud computing, and AI research, drawing on 100 peer-reviewed articles and industry reports from 2015 to 2025. The proposed architecture integrates real-time data ingestion, anomaly detection, threat classification, and automated response, optimized for scalability and resilience. Key findings reveal that architecture achieves 95\% accuracy in detecting advanced threats, reducing false positives by 20\% compared to traditional systems. However, challenges such as computational complexity, data privacy, and integration with legacy systems pose significant hurdles. Opportunities include leveraging federated learning and quantum computing to enhance detection capabilities. The study contributes to cybersecurity literature by offering a scalable, AI-driven architecture that balances performance and practicality, with implications for cloud providers, enterprises, and policymakers. For practitioners, architecture provides a blueprint for securing cloud environments, while researchers can explore future directions, such as AI explainability and zero-trust integration. By addressing architecture design, challenges, and opportunities, this paper underscores the transformative potential of AI-based threat detection in safeguarding cloud infrastructure, fostering resilience, and enabling secure digital transformation in an increasingly threat-prone landscape.},
