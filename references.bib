Cloud-native architectures which are founded on concepts such as serverless computing, microservices, orchestration and containerization create a solid foundation in satisfying these needs. Dividing its emphasis between distributed model training, real-time inference, and automated lifecycle management, this paper explores how cloud-native technology acts to enable large-scale AI-based predictive modeling. By integrating MLOps practices with elastic cloud infrastructure, organizations will be able to realize better fault tolerance, faster deployment schedules, and the most efficient use of resources. The proposed methodology demonstrates that cloud-native ideas can help AI systems work with a vast amount of data, dynamically adapt to changing loads, and maintain high performance levels in the actual environment.

As modern software systems grow in complexity, the need for intelligent automation to optimize CI/CD processes has become critical. This paper investigates the integration of AI-driven predictive models in DevOps pipelines, focusing on their ability to forecast build failures, optimize resource allocation, and streamline testing and deployment cycles. The study explores various AI techniques, including machine learning algorithms like regression, clustering, and neural networks, to address specific challenges in CI/CD processes. Predictive models trained on historical pipeline data can identify patterns, detect anomalies, and recommend proactive actions to prevent bottlenecks and failures. Additionally, the use of reinforcement learning enables dynamic resource management, ensuring efficient scaling during peak workloads. Key case studies illustrate the application of AI-driven predictive models in optimizing Jenkins and GitLab pipelines, achieving significant reductions in build times and improving deployment success rates. The research also highlights the role of AI in prioritizing test cases, automating performance monitoring, and enhancing feedback loops for continuous improvement. While emphasizing the benefits of AI integration, this paper also addresses challenges such as data quality, algorithm selection, and organizational readiness for adopting intelligent systems.

Through extensive experimentation and statistical analysis, we demonstrate that RL-driven approaches significantly outperform traditional methods, achieving improvements of up to 25\% in resource utilization, 30\% in load distribution fairness, and 40\% in fault recovery time.

But the fast-delivery strategy hugely opened the gates to cyber threats, giving CI/CD pipelines the status of most-sought cyber-hacking targets. Traditional static security models have been frequently experienced to fail in in line with the dynamic nature of CI/CD workflows, hence allowing undetected vulnerabilities to persist and prolonging remediation. This study proposes the utilization of reinforcement learning (RL) for optimizing cybersecurity risk modeling and testing in CI/CD pipelines. The system makes maximum use of real-time threat intelligence, in combination with dynamic test selection techniques, toward maximum detection of vulnerabilities within the smallest possible amount of resource allocation. RL agents are trained to always push severe test scenarios first in a way to better absorb changing attacks and codebase dynamics. Empirical study results show improved detection rates, less test time, and better risk visibility in all stages of the pipeline, marking a major fight toward intelligent and adaptive DevOps security practices.},

The most recent guidelines for systematic mapping are from 2008. Since that time, many suggestions have been made of how to improve systematic literature reviews (SLRs). There is a need to evaluate how researchers conduct the process of systematic mapping and identify how the guidelines should be updated based on the lessons learned from the existing systematic maps and SLR guidelines. Objective To identify how the systematic mapping process is conducted (including search, study selection, analysis and presentation of data, etc.); to identify improvement potentials in conducting the systematic mapping process and updating the guidelines accordingly. Method We conducted a systematic mapping study of systematic maps, considering some practices of systematic review guidelines as well (in particular in relation to defining the search and to conduct a quality assessment). Results In a large number of studies multiple guidelines are used and combined, which leads to different ways in conducting mapping studies. The reason for combining guidelines was that they differed in the recommendations given. Conclusion The most frequently followed guidelines are not sufficient alone. Hence, there was a need to provide an update of how to conduct systematic mapping studies. New guidelines have been proposed consolidating existing findings.},

To overcome these challenges, this work employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks that analyze historical performance data collected from AWS CloudWatch. The system forecasts resource demand trends for EC2 and RDS instances and automates scaling actions using the Boto3 SDK. It evaluates multiple metrics-including CPU usage, memory availability, disk I/O, and network traffic-to make accurate, real-time decisions. Operating in a continuous loop, the model updates hourly to adapt to changing workloads. Experimental evaluation confirms that the proposed approach reduces operational costs and enhances performance reliability.

  abstract = {The growing popularity of machine learning (ML) and the integration of ML components with other software artifacts has led to the use of continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) tools, such as Travis CI, GitHub Actions, etc. that enable faster integration and testing for ML projects. Such CI/CD configurations and services require synchronization during the life cycle of the projects. Several works discussed how CI/CD configuration and services change during their usage in traditional software systems. However, there is very limited knowledge of how CI/CD configuration and services change in ML projects. To fill this knowledge gap, this work presents the first empirical analysis of how CI/CD configuration evolves for ML software systems. We manually analyzed 343 commits collected from 508 open-source ML projects to identify common CI/CD configuration change categories in ML projects and devised a taxonomy of 14 co-changes in CI/CD and ML components. Moreover, we developed a CI/CD configuration change clustering tool that identified frequent CI/CD configuration change patterns in 15,634 commits. Furthermore, we measured the expertise of ML developers who modify CI/CD configurations. Based on this analysis, we found that 61.8\% of commits include a change to the build policy and minimal changes related to performance and maintainability compared to general open-source projects. Additionally, the co-evolution analysis identified that CI/CD configurations, in many cases, changed unnecessarily due to bad practices such as the direct inclusion of dependencies and a lack of usage of standardized testing frameworks. More practices were found through the change patterns analysis consisting of using deprecated settings and reliance on a generic build language. Finally, our developer's expertise analysis suggests that experienced developers are more inclined to modify CI/CD configurations.},

  abstract = {The rapid adoption of cloud infrastructure has transformed organizational operations, offered scalability and flexibility but also exposed enterprises to sophisticated cyber threats, such as data breaches, ransomware, and insider attacks. AI-based threat detection systems have emerged as a critical solution, leveraging machine learning, deep learning, and behavioral analytics to identify and mitigate threats in real time. This paper proposes novel architecture for AI-based threat detection in cloud infrastructure, addressing the unique challenges of dynamic, distributed environments. Through a systematic literature review and mixed-method evaluation, the study synthesizes insights from cybersecurity, cloud computing, and AI research, drawing on 100 peer-reviewed articles and industry reports from 2015 to 2025. The proposed architecture integrates real-time data ingestion, anomaly detection, threat classification, and automated response, optimized for scalability and resilience. Key findings reveal that architecture achieves 95\% accuracy in detecting advanced threats, reducing false positives by 20\% compared to traditional systems. However, challenges such as computational complexity, data privacy, and integration with legacy systems pose significant hurdles. Opportunities include leveraging federated learning and quantum computing to enhance detection capabilities. The study contributes to cybersecurity literature by offering a scalable, AI-driven architecture that balances performance and practicality, with implications for cloud providers, enterprises, and policymakers. For practitioners, architecture provides a blueprint for securing cloud environments, while researchers can explore future directions, such as AI explainability and zero-trust integration. By addressing architecture design, challenges, and opportunities, this paper underscores the transformative potential of AI-based threat detection in safeguarding cloud infrastructure, fostering resilience, and enabling secure digital transformation in an increasingly threat-prone landscape.},
